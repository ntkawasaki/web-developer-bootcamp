    <h2>Part 1: Speed to Fly</h2>
    <p>One of the more important skills in wingsuit flying is the ability to fly fast safely in formation with your friends. Much of what you need to know about flying well, can be learned from practicing this one skill. In parts 1 and 2, Richard Webb explained to us what speed means in terms of safety in wingsuit flight, and how to understand the relationship between stability and drag. In this third part, let’s try to understand how to get our speed on.</p>

    <p>The aim of this article is to clarify some points on wingsuit flight, and to encourage pilots to learn to fly fast. Words are thoughts, and in order to think clearly about our progression we need to cut inaccurate terminology from our sport. I want to believe that you are willing to take the time to try and understand more than opening or closing your butt cheeks (see fig. 1b). It’s fun to pretend to be an airplane, but your ass is not an elevator.</p>

    <p>In this article, we will try to explain two separate fundamentals of wingsuit flight: Angle of Attack, and Wingsuit Configuration (formerly known as “Body Position”). We will examine how separating these two concepts and thinking about them independently may help us to fly better.</p>

    <h2>What is Wingsuit Performance, Anyway?</h2>

    <p>Wingsuit pilots often ask us what “tricks” we recommend for increasing performance. Many of the tips we have heard are based on the idea that “performance flying” is gliding for distance at flat, slow, minimum-sink angles. While flying slowly is not always a problem in the skydiving environment, it is not ideal. So how fast should we be going in any given situation? This concept in gliding flight is sometimes referred to as “Speed to Fly”. Luckily, for wingsuit flying it’s not that complicated. The answer to this question is, generally: “As fast as possible”.</p>

    <p>The idea that “speed is good” is surprisingly uncommon in today’s world of wingsuit instruction. I am of the opinion that a fundamental misunderstanding of proper airspeeds has led to unnecessary wingsuit BASE fatalities in which pilots have been without the skill resources needed to assess or complete a line of flight. Many skydivers are being taught to fly their wingsuits too slowly to make use of their suit’s full potential, and many more totally lack an understanding of what healthy forward speed is. While this is not just a wingsuit BASE issue, from August 2015 to October 2016 more than 10 BASE fatalities can be attributed to improper airspeed.</p>

    <p>So, when we want to fly our wingsuits at max performance, what do we mean? Is max performance flying far, or flying fast, or flying for a long period of time? I would argue that the most important aspect of performance flight to focus on is horizontal speed with precision and control.</p>

    <h2>The Flysight GPS</h2>

    <p>This isn't an article, it's just a blatant and shameless recommendation that all wingsuit pilots buy a FlySight GPS unit. The FlySight is small, accurate, easy to use, and was created by BASE jumpers for BASE jumpers. <a href="http://www.flysight.ca/" target="_blank">FlySight</a></p>

    <p>Knowing your speed and glide ratio is not necessarily important, but it is fun, and if you maintain an awareness of how you are flying on each jump then you can use the data as a tool to progress.</p>

    <p>Some general thoughts on GPS usage and the FlySight:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Wind and thermals can have a tremendous effect on flight data. The speed and glide recorded on the GPS is never your true speed and glide. A head or tailwind can change your l/d by a full point of glide (i.e. 3:1 to 2:1) and will obviously also change your groundspeed significantly. Your GPS measures horizontal groundspeed, not airspeed.</li>
      <li>The main feature of the FlySight is the audible tone which indicates glide performance. This is a fun and useful tool which can really improve your glide performance. Practice with it in the skydive environment and calibrate the volume carefully before you take it BASE jumping.</li>
      <li>Even if you never use the audible tone and don't think you need it, the FlySight is still one of the most compact quality GPS units that you can buy. Mine works well slipped into my arm wing, or fastened to my helmet.</li>
