  <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

  <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

  <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
      <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

  <h2>Storage</h2>
  <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

  <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>

  <h1>Important notice</h1>
  <p>On Sunday January 9th 2010, a <strong>gang of goths</strong> were spotted stealing several garden gnomes from a shopping center in downtown Milwaukee. They were all wearing <strong>green jumpsuits</strong> and <strong>silly hats</strong>, and seemed
    to be having a whale of a time.</p>
